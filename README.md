# Tommi's Gen AI Resources

Hi! I'm Tommi, VP of Product at [Robocorp](https://robocorp.com/). We are building a scalable framework for running Python automation workflows. Developers from hobbyists to enterprise operators use our platform to:
- operate RAG data loaders in scale
- expose and API, app or system to Generative AI agents as Skills, Tools or Activities

Robocorp is based in San Francisco and backed by top investors like [Benchmark Capital](https://www.benchmark.com/), [Canvas Ventures](https://www.canvas.vc/), [Slow Ventures](https://slow-prod.herokuapp.com/) and [Harpoon](https://harpoon.vc/).

The following links showcase the contributions and content related to the generative AI topic.

## Code examples and repos

- **[Langchain Prompt Templates from Robocorp Asset Storage](https://robocorp.com/portal/robot/tonnitommi/example-prompt-template-assets)** - Maintain prompt templates in Robocorp Asset Storage and improve them without touching the code.

- **[LLM data ingestion pipeline with Langchain & Robocorp](https://robocorp.com/portal/robot/robocorp/example-langchain-data-ingestion)** - Schedule and run your Python RAG data loaders in the cloud with Robocorp Control Room. This example shows how [Robocorp's code gen assistant ReMarkðŸ’¬'s](https://chat.robocorp.com) vector embeddings are created in production.

- **[Speech-to-text AI Examples](https://robocorp.com/portal/robot/robocorp/example-whisper-transcribe)** - An example for an enterprise user working in the medical field to transcribe recordings to text. Uses OpenAI Whisper API from Huggingface Inference Endpoints to transcribe speech to text.

- **[OpenAI LLM Email Assistant](https://robocorp.com/portal/robot/robocorp/example-llm-emails)** - An example where we worked with a Fortune 200 customer to optimise their payment collections process, using LLMs to summarize email threads, suggest replies and extract structured data that can be then added to Accounts Receivable system. Summarise and extract structured data from emails using OpenAI gpt-4.

## Robocorp ReMarkðŸ’¬

- **[Robocorp ReMarkðŸ’¬](https://chat.robocorp.com/)** - Creating a domain-specific co-pilot to help Robocorp developers build their automation faster. The initial version was based on the RAG model, and the direction is to build this using the Agent framework and allow enterprise customers to add their own data (like process descriptions, shared library documentation etc).
